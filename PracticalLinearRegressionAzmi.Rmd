# Practical Session

## Load data

dataset datamssm_a.dta was imported to environement, and named as DataSet01

## Linear Regression for Model 1

univariable, simple linear regression for model 1, named as Model01

```{r}
Model01 <- lm(hba1c ~ ldl, data = DataSet01)
summary(Model01)
```
\[ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \epsilon ]
